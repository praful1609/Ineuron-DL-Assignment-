    "1. **Activation Functions Explained:**\n",
    "   - **Sigmoid:** The sigmoid function transforms its input into a range between 0 and 1. It's often used in binary classification problems to squash the output to represent probabilities.\n",
    "   - **Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent):** Tanh is similar to the sigmoid but transforms its input to a range between -1 and 1. It's used in neural networks for hidden layers.\n",
    "   - **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** ReLU is a simple and popular activation function that outputs the input directly if it's positive and sets it to zero if it's negative. It's computationally efficient and helps in mitigating vanishing gradient issues.\n",
    "   - **ELU (Exponential Linear Unit):** ELU is an activation function that, like ReLU, is linear for positive inputs but has a non-zero gradient for negative inputs. This helps in addressing vanishing gradient problems and can be more robust.\n",
    "   - **LeakyReLU:** Leaky ReLU is similar to ReLU but allows a small gradient for negative inputs, preventing dead neurons.\n",
    "   - **Swish:** Swish is an activation function that combines elements of sigmoid and ReLU. It has a smooth curve and can be more effective in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Effect of Learning Rate:**\n",
    "   - Increasing the learning rate can make training faster but may result in overshooting the optimal solution and divergence.\n",
    "   - Decreasing the learning rate can make training more stable and accurate but may slow down convergence or get stuck in local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Effect of Increasing Hidden Neurons:**\n",
    "   - Increasing the number of hidden neurons can increase the model's capacity to learn complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "   - However, too many hidden neurons can lead to overfitting if not properly regularized. It can also increase training time and require more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Effect of Increasing Batch Size:**\n",
    "   - Increasing the batch size can lead to faster training because it processes more examples in parallel, utilizing hardware more efficiently.\n",
    "   - However, very large batch sizes may require more memory and can lead to slower convergence if the learning rate is not adjusted accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Regularization to Avoid Overfitting:**\n",
    "   - Regularization techniques are adopted in deep learning to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model learns to fit the training data too closely, capturing noise and performing poorly on new data.\n",
    "   - Regularization methods like L1, L2 regularization, and dropout introduce penalties or noise during training, encouraging the model to generalize better.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Loss and Cost Functions:**\n",
    "   - Loss and cost functions measure the error between the predicted values of a model and the actual target values in the training data.\n",
    "   - Loss functions are typically used during training to compute gradients and adjust model parameters.\n",
    "   - Cost functions are often used for evaluation and optimization purposes, aggregating the loss over the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Underfitting in Neural Networks:**\n",
    "   - Underfitting occurs when a neural network fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data during training.\n",
    "   - It results in a model that performs poorly on both the training data and new, unseen data.\n",
    "   - Underfit models are usually too simple, with insufficient capacity to represent the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Use of Dropout in Neural Networks:**\n",
    "   - Dropout is used in neural networks as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "   - It randomly deactivates a fraction of neurons during each training step, forcing the network to learn more robust and generalized features.\n",
    "   - Dropout acts as an ensemble method during training, improving the model's ability to generalize to new data."
