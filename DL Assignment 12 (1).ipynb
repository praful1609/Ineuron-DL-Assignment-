    "class DenseLayer:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):\n",

    "4. **Python Code for Dense Layer in Plain Python:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def dense_layer(input_data, weights, bias):\n",
    "    # Ensure input_data, weights, and bias have compatible shapes\n",
    "    assert len(input_data) == len(weights[0])\n",
    "    assert len(weights) == len(bias)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Perform matrix multiplication and add bias\n",
    "    output = [sum(x * w for x, w in zip(input_data, col)) + b for col, b in zip(zip(*weights), bias)]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hidden Size of a Layer:**\n",
    "   - The hidden size of a layer refers to the number of neurons or units in that layer. It represents the dimensionality of the layer's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`t` Method in PyTorch:**\n",
    "   - In PyTorch, the `.t()` method is used to transpose a tensor. It swaps the dimensions of the tensor. For example, if you have a 2D tensor with shape (rows, columns), calling `.t()` will transpose it to (columns, rows).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Matrix Multiplication in Plain Python:**\n",
    "   - Matrix multiplication in plain Python is slow because it involves nested loops to iterate over elements, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^3) for two n x n matrices. NumPy or specialized libraries optimize these operations using lower-level routines and parallelization, making them significantly faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **In `matmul`, Why Is `ac == br`?**\n",
    "   - In matrix multiplication `matmul`, the number of columns (c) in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows (b) in the second matrix for the operation to be defined and result in a valid product. Hence, `ac == br` ensures compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Measuring Execution Time in Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
    "   - You can use the `%timeit` magic command in Jupyter Notebook to measure the execution time of a single cell. For example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     %timeit some_function()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Elementwise Arithmetic:**\n",
    "    - Elementwise arithmetic refers to performing operations individually on corresponding elements of two or more arrays or tensors. It involves applying the same operation to each pair of elements at corresponding positions in the arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **PyTorch Code to Test Elementwise Comparison:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "\n",
    "a = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "b = torch.tensor([2, 2, 2])\n",
    "\n",
    "result = a > b  # Elementwise comparison\n",
    "print(result)  # Outputs a tensor with boolean values\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Rank-0 Tensor and Conversion:**\n",
    "    - A rank-0 tensor in PyTorch is a scalar, a tensor with no dimensions.\n",
    "    - You can convert a rank-0 tensor to a plain Python data type using the `.item()` method. For example:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      tensor_scalar = torch.tensor(5)  # Rank-0 tensor (scalar)\n",
    "      python_scalar = tensor_scalar.item()\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Elementwise Arithmetic and Speeding up `matmul`:**\n",
    "    - Elementwise arithmetic helps speed up `matmul` by allowing parallelization of element-wise operations, which can be optimized using hardware-level instructions and libraries like NumPy or TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Broadcasting Rules:**\n",
    "    - Broadcasting is a technique that allows operations between arrays of different shapes to be performed as if they had the same shape, subject to certain rules.\n",
    "    - Broadcasting starts with comparing dimensions element-wise and proceeds with these rules: \n",
    "      1. If dimensions are equal, no action is needed.\n",
    "      2. If one dimension is missing (size 1), it is expanded to match the other dimension.\n",
    "      3. If neither dimension is size 1, broadcasting is not possible, and it raises an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **`expand_as` Method in PyTorch:**\n",
    "    - The `expand_as` method in PyTorch is used to expand the dimensions of a tensor to match the dimensions of another tensor. It is used for broadcasting operations.\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      a = torch.tensor([1, 2])        # Shape: (2,)\n",
    "      b = torch.tensor([[3], [4]])    # Shape: (2, 1)\n",
    "      result = a.expand_as(b)         # Expands 'a' to match the shape of 'b'\n",
    "      ```"
